# Deep Learning

This repo contains deep learning models written in Pytorch

## Faster R-CNN
This folder contains an implementation of Region Proposal Network, as proposed by authors of Faster RCNN : Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, Jian Sun for the 4 step alternate training process. 

DISCLAIMER: The work was heavily influenced by the Faster RCNN Repository of chenyuntc ([link](https://github.com/chenyuntc/simple-faster-rcnn-pytorch)) and pottersu's implementation of faster RCNN ([link](https://github.com/potterhsu/easy-faster-rcnn.pytorch)). Both of these are excellent implementations of Faster R-CNN. The utilities required to use the RPN are also taken from chenyuntc's repo.
