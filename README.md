# Deep Learning

This repo contains deep learning models written in Pytorch

## Faster R-CNN
This folder contains an implementation of Region Proposal Network, as proposed by authors of Faster RCNN : Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, Jian Sun for the 4 step alternate training process. 

DISCLAIMER: The work was heavily influenced by the Faster RCNN Repository of chenyuntc ([link](https://github.com/chenyuntc/simple-faster-rcnn-pytorch)) and pottersu's implementation of faster RCNN ([link](https://github.com/potterhsu/easy-faster-rcnn.pytorch)). Both of these are excellent implementations of Faster R-CNN. The utilities required to use the RPN are also taken from chenyuntc's repo. 

## GAN
My contribution to this implementation of a Genarative Adversarial Network for CIFAR10 dataset is the model architecture and some of the training procedure. The practical skeleton of the code was provided by our outstanding instructors at IE 534: Deep Learning, Fall 2018, UIUC.
